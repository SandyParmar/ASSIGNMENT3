# ASSIGNMENT3
**Part 1: Factorial Calculator**
1. It first defines a function called `inputNumber()` that keeps asking the user for a number until they enter a valid **integer**. If someone types something like a letter or a word, it shows an error and asks again.
2. Once the user gives a valid number, the program:
   - Prints the entered value
   - Calculates the **factorial** of that number using recursion with the `factorial()` function.
   - Displays the result in a clean format like:  
     **"The factorial of 5 is 120"**

**Part 2: Math Operations Using `math` Module**
1. It again asks the user to input a number (separately from the factorial part).
2. It calculates:
   - The **square root** of the number  
   - The **natural logarithm** (log base **e**)  
   - The **sine** of the number in **radians**
3. Finally, it prints out each of these results.

###Example
If the user enters `25`, the program will output:

Enter a number :25
Enter value 25
The factorial of 25 is 15511210043330985984000000

Enter a number: 25
Square Root: 5.0
Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303
